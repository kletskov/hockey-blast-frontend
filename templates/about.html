    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>This site was created while I was in-between jobs and had enough time to make it happen. There are multiple ideas
        to make it better and cooler. The list of feature requests resides in this <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S08CGLYeZUliNHHQxgy227yq5hlLcWjN2J44A8TnkXM/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Future of this Project</h2>
    <p>I am starting a new daytime job soon, so the features will be implemented at a much slower pace. If you have your
        own idea of what to add or would like to handle something from the features list, it should be straightforward.
        Follow the simple setup described in the frontend's <a
            href="https://github.com/kletskov/hockey-blast-frontend/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> and then see how
        the code is structured. A pair of blueprint Python and template HTML files define every endpoint. Modify
        existing ones or create a new one, verify in your local setup that it works, and submit a request to add it to
        the repo.</p>
    <p>With the help of modern LLM (I use VSCode + Copilot), there is no need to know Python, JavaScript, or HTML. Just
        explain what you want to do, and it will most likely do the job for you. I am looking forward to working with
        you and approving your requests. Let's have a BLAST!</p>
