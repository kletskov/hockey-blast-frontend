    <h2>GitHub Repositories</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/kletskov/hockey-blast-frontend">Frontend code for data presentation</a>
    </p>
    <p>This project depends on:</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/kletskov/hockey-blast-common-lib">Library for DB abstraction and stats
            aggregation</a></p>

    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>This site was created during a period when I was between jobs and had the time to bring it to life. It started
        with the idea of building a few plots to visualize some data points I was interested in <a
            href="https://hockey-blast.com/special_stats">here</a>, but it quickly grew into something much larger.
        There are numerous ideas to make it even better and more exciting.</p>

    <h2>Project Future</h2>
    <p>I have a daytime job now, so new features will be implemented at a slower pace. If you have your
        own ideas for improvements or would like to tackle something from the <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S08CGLYeZUliNHHQxgy227yq5hlLcWjN2J44A8TnkXM/edit?usp=sharing">feature
            requests</a>, it should be quite straightforward. Follow the simple setup described in the frontend's <a
            href="https://github.com/kletskov/hockey-blast-frontend/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> to get the
        website running locally with the sample DB in just a few minutes. Then, see how the code is structured. Each
        endpoint is defined by a pair of blueprint Python and template HTML files. Modify existing ones or create new
        ones, verify that they work in your local setup, and submit a request to add them to the repository.</p>
    <p>With the help of modern LLMs (I use VSCode + Copilot), there is no need to know Python, JavaScript, or HTML. Just
        explain what you want to do in plain English, and it will most likely do the job for you. I look forward to
        working with you and approving your requests. Let's have a BLAST!</p>
